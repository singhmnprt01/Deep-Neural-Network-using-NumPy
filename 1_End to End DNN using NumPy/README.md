# DNN using NumPy
This is 4 layers Deep Neural Network with 3 hidden layers.The architecture of the network is highlighted inside the py file. The soul aim of this code is to learnt the nitty gritty of the networks and how the network flow works. The code has been divided into functions based on NN functionalities, namely:-
1. Input layer (data input in a matrix)
2. Paramters ( weights {W} and bais {b} ) initialization
3. Forward Propagation through the network to predict the final output ( using ReLU and Sigmoid activation function )
4. Compute the cost function
5. Back Propagation a.k.a Gradient Descent
6. Weight and bias updates 
7. Repeat steps 3 - 6 until cost is minimized or number of iterations (epochs) are reached.

Also, below is the link to my webiste where I have explained the working,terminologies, mathematics and functionality of Neural Networks. It is advisable to visit and read the blog before you try this code.

FYI,
This is fairly a simple yet effective example to learn the functionality and matrix calculations inside a NN. Future codes will have advance features like regularization (dropout), exponentiually weighted average, Batch GD, GD with momentum, Adam, Batch Norm etc.
