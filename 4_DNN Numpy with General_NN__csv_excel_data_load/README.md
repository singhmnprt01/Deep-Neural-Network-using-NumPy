Same NN code as previous py file with followig features added :-
1. Generalised the network - user input to create layers number and neurons per layer in the network
2. Load file from your storage (csv or excel) and run the DNN on it


Also, below is the link to my webiste where I have explained the working,terminologies, mathematics and functionality of Neural Networks. It is advisable to visit and read the blog before you try this code.
